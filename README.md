# MochaPayment System

MochaPayment is a full-stack demo application featuring a Node.js/Express backend and a React frontend. It demonstrates basic authentication, protected routes, and a simple payment form.

## Features
- User authentication (demo, localStorage-based)
- Protected dashboard and payment routes
- React frontend with navigation
- Express backend serving static and API routes

## üöÄ Getting Started

Welcome to the MochaPayment ecosystem.

### üîê 1. Authentication Flow
- **Login Endpoint:** Users authenticate via `/api/auth/login` using valid credentials or OAuth (Google/GitHub).
- **Token Issuance:** Upon successful login, the server responds with an encrypted JWT token stored in HTTP-only cookies or localStorage.
- **Session Validation:** Protected endpoints validate the token on each request using middleware to ensure secure access.

### üß≠ 2. User Actions Post-Login
Once authenticated, users can:
- Access their dashboard with `/api/user/profile`.
- Perform wallet operations like deposits, withdrawals, or transaction history (`/api/wallet`, `/api/transactions`).
- Update personal settings via `/api/user/update`.

### üö™ 3. Logout Flow
- **Logout Endpoint:** When a user hits `/api/auth/logout`, the session token is invalidated and cleared from storage.
- **Redirect or Confirmation:** Users are optionally redirected to the login screen or receive a logout confirmation.
